0x1A. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
====================================
C programming at [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com). The purpose of these assignments is to introduce the C programming language, specifically sorting algorithms and Big O.

The algorithms covered include:
* Bubble Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Selection Sort
* Quick Sort
* Shell Sort
* Cocktail Shaker Sort
* Counting Sort
* Merge Sort
* Heap Sort
* Radix Sort
* Bitonic Sort

C Requirements
--------------
* All programs are compiled Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using gcc 4.8.4 (C90) using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic.
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic
```

* All code conforms to [Betty style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty).
* Global variables are not allowed.
* Standard library is not allowed(with exceptions).
* Allowed functions:
  * [_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c)
* Functions provided by Holberton School:
  * print_array
  * print_list
* main.c functions provided by Holberton School for testing
