0x1D. C - Search Algorithms
===========================
C programming at [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com). The purpose of these assignments is to introduce the C programming language, specifically search algorighms and space complexity.

The algorithms covered include:
* Linear search
* Binary search
* Jump search
* Interpolation search
* Exponential search

C Requirements
--------------
* All programs are compiled Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using gcc 4.8.4 (C90) using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic.
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic
```

* All code conforms to [Betty style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty).
* Global variables are not allowed.
* Standard library is not allowed(with exceptions).
* Allowed functions:
  * printf
* main.c functions provided by Holberton School for testing
